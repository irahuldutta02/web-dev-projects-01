            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Mahendra Singh Dhoni ( born 7
                    July 1981) is an Indian former professional cricketer who was captain of the Indian national cricket
                    team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is a right
                    handed wicket-keeper batsman. He led the team to three ICC trophies including the 2007 ICC World
                    Twenty20, 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. Under his captaincy, India won
                    the ACC Asia Cup two times, in 2010 and 2016. India also won ICC Test Championship Mace two times in
                    2010, 2011 and ICC ODI Shield for one time in 2013 under his leadership. He is considered as one of
                    the greatest Captains and Wicket Keeper Batsman of all time. Throughout his 15 year long
                    international career, Dhoni has won several awards and accolades.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">In Indian domestic cricket he
                    played for Bihar and Jharkhand Cricket team. He is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the
                    Indian Premier League. He captained the side to championships in the 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021
                    editions of IPL league. Also under his captaincy Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Won Champions League T20
                    two times, in 2010 and 2014.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23
                    December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong, and played his first Test a year later against Sri
                    Lanka. He played his first T20I also a year later against South Africa. In 2007, he took over the
                    ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as T20I captain of India in this year. In 2008,
                    he was selected as Test Captain. His captaincy record in this format was mixed, successfully leading
                    India to a series win against New Zealand in 2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in
                    2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by
                    big margins in away conditions.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Comic Sans MS,cursive">He announced his retirement
                    from Test format on 30 December 2014,&nbsp;and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On
                    15 August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and continues to play in
                    the&nbsp;IPL.</span></p>

            <h2 style="text-align:justify">Early life and background</h2>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni was born in&nbsp;Ranchi,&nbsp;Bihar&nbsp;(now in&nbsp;Jharkhand) and
                hails from a&nbsp;Hindu&nbsp;Rajput&nbsp;family with roots in&nbsp;Uttarakhand.&nbsp;He is the youngest
                of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.&nbsp;His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil,
                Lamgara block of the&nbsp;Almora District&nbsp;of&nbsp;Uttarakhand.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Previously Dhoni was the&nbsp;goalkeeper&nbsp;for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir
                school&#39;s football team,&nbsp;but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee,
                one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.&nbsp;His
                exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket
                Club (1995&ndash;1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season
                Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a&nbsp;Travelling Ticket
                Examiner&nbsp;(TTE) at&nbsp;Kharagpur railway station&nbsp;under South Eastern Railway
                in&nbsp;Midnapore&nbsp;(W), a district in&nbsp;West Bengal.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:justify">Early career</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Junior cricket in Bihar</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association
                Vice President and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the&nbsp;Central Coal Fields
                Limited&nbsp;(CCL) team.&nbsp;Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional
                cricket. At CCL, he got an opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally,
                which had helped CCL move to the A division.&nbsp;Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for
                his selection in the Bihar team.&nbsp;Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team and
                eventually the senior&nbsp;Bihar Ranji Team&nbsp;within one year.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In the 1998&ndash;99 Cooch Behar Trophy, Dhoni played for the U-19 Bihar team
                and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings). However, Bihar finished fourth in the group of six and did
                not make it to the quarter-finals. Dhoni was not picked for the East Zone U-19 squad (CK
                Nayudu&nbsp;Trophy) or Rest of India squad (MA Chidambaram Trophy and&nbsp;Vinoo Mankad Trophy). In the
                1999&ndash;2000 Cooch Behar Trophy, the Bihar U-19 cricket team made it to the finals, where Dhoni&#39;s
                84 helped Bihar post a total of 357.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Bihar&#39;s efforts were thwarted
                by&nbsp;Punjab&#39;s&nbsp;839 with Dhoni&#39;s future teammate&nbsp;Yuvraj Singh&nbsp;making
                358.&nbsp;Dhoni&#39;s contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5
                fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings.&nbsp;Dhoni made it to the East Zone U-19 squad for the CK Nayudu
                trophy in the 1999&ndash;2000 season but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as East Zone lost all four
                matches and finished last in the tournament.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Bihar cricket team</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni made his&nbsp;Ranji Trophy&nbsp;debut for Bihar in the 1999&ndash;2000
                season, as an eighteen-year-old. He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second
                innings against&nbsp;Assam cricket team.&nbsp;Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches.
                Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for Bihar against&nbsp;Bengal&nbsp;in the
                2000/01 season, this match ended as draw&nbsp;Apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01
                season&nbsp;did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five
                fifties in four Ranji matches.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Jharkhand cricket team</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni&#39;s performance in the 2002&ndash;03 season included three
                half-centuries in the Ranji Trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started
                gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the
                2003/04 season, Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the&nbsp;Ranji
                ODI&nbsp;tournament. Dhoni was part of the&nbsp;East Zone&nbsp;squad that won the&nbsp;Deodhar
                Trophy&nbsp;2003&ndash;2004 season&nbsp;and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches,<span
                    style="font-size:10.8333px"> </span>including a century (114) against Central zone.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international
                cricketer&nbsp;Deep Dasgupta&nbsp;to represent East Zone.&nbsp;He scored a fighting half-century in the
                second innings in a losing cause.&nbsp;Dhoni&#39;s talent was discovered via the&nbsp;BCCI&#39;s
                small-town talent-spotting initiative&nbsp;TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO&nbsp;Prakash Poddar,
                captain of&nbsp;Bengal&nbsp;in the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for&nbsp;Jharkhand&nbsp;at a match
                in&nbsp;Jamshedpur&nbsp;in 2003, and sent a report to the&nbsp;National Cricket Academy.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">India A team</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One
                Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against the Zimbabwe
                XI in Harare Sports Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the
                match. In the tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase
                down their target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. Continuing his good performance, he
                scored back to back centuries – 120 and 119* – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings
                at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain
                – Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:justify">International career</h2>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Start of ODI career</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw&nbsp;Rahul Dravid&nbsp;as the
                wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn&#39;t lack in batting talent.&nbsp;The team
                also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like&nbsp;Parthiv
                Patel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dinesh Karthik&nbsp;(both&nbsp;India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads.<span
                    style="font-size:10.8333px"> </span>Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the
                ODI squad for the&nbsp;Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.&nbsp;Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI
                career, getting&nbsp;run out&nbsp;for a duck on debut.&nbsp;In spite of an average series
                against&nbsp;Bangladesh, Dhoni was picked for the Pakistan ODI series.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Breakthrough</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In the second match of the&nbsp;series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day
                international, scored 148 in&nbsp;Visakhapatnam&nbsp;off only 123 deliveries. Dhoni&#39;s 148 surpassed
                the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper,&nbsp;a record that he would
                re-write before the end of the year.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the&nbsp;Sri
                Lankan bilateral ODI series (October&ndash;November 2005)&nbsp;and was promoted to No. 3 in the third
                ODI at&nbsp;Sawai Mansingh Stadium&nbsp;(Jaipur). Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after
                a&nbsp;Kumar Sangakkara&nbsp;century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to
                accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for
                India.&nbsp;The innings was described in&nbsp;Wisden Almanack&nbsp;(2006) as &#39;Uninhibited, yet
                anything but crude&#39;.&nbsp;The innings set various&nbsp;records&nbsp;including the highest individual
                score in ODI cricket in the second innings,&nbsp;a record only broken after seven years by&nbsp;Shane
                Watson.&nbsp;Dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346)&nbsp;and was awarded the Man of
                the Series award for his efforts. In December 2005, Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by
                the&nbsp;BCCI.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><img alt=""
                    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/MS_Dhoni_bowling.jpg/170px-MS_Dhoni_bowling.jpg"
                    style="height:381px; width:170px" /></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni bowling in the nets. He rarely bowled at international level.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India scored 328 in 50 overs with Dhoni contributing 68 in their first match
                of 2006 against&nbsp;Pakistan. However, the team finished poorly, scoring just 43 runs in the last eight
                overs and lost the match due to&nbsp;Duckworth-Lewis method.<span style="font-size:10.8333px"> </span>In
                the third match of the series, Dhoni came in with India in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off
                just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help India take a 2&ndash;1 lead in the series.&nbsp;The
                final match of the series had a repeat performance as Dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable India
                win the series 4&ndash;1.&nbsp;Due to his consistent ODI performances, Dhoni overtook&nbsp;Ricky
                Ponting&nbsp;as number one in the&nbsp;ICC ODI Rankings&nbsp;for batsmen on 20 April 2006, becoming the
                fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings.&nbsp;His reign lasted just a week as&nbsp;Adam Gilchrist&#39;s
                performance against&nbsp;Bangladesh&nbsp;moved him to the top spot.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Two cancelled series in Sri Lanka, one due to the withdrawal of South Africa
                from the Unitech Cup due to security concerns&nbsp;and the replacement three-match ODI bilateral series
                against Sri Lanka washed due to rain,&nbsp;was India&#39;s prelude to another disappointing tournament
                &ndash;&nbsp;DLF Cup 2006-07. Dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not
                qualify for the finals. India&#39;s lack of preparation showed in the&nbsp;2006 ICC Champions
                Trophy&nbsp;as they lost to&nbsp;West Indies&nbsp;and&nbsp;Australia, though Dhoni scored a half-century
                against West Indies. The story of the&nbsp;ODI series&nbsp;in&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;was the same for
                both Dhoni and India as Dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and India lost the series 4&ndash;0. From the
                start of the West Indies ODI series, Dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged
                25.93. Dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper&nbsp;Syed
                Kirmani.&nbsp;Yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">2007 World Cup</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Preparations for the&nbsp;2007 Cricket World Cup&nbsp;improved as India
                recorded identical 3&ndash;1 victories over&nbsp;West Indies&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sri Lanka&nbsp;and Dhoni had
                averages in excess of 100 in both these series.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh and
                Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a&nbsp;duck&nbsp;in both these matches and scored just
                29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to&nbsp;Bangladesh&nbsp;in&nbsp;2007 Cricket World Cup, the
                house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political
                activists of&nbsp;JMM.&nbsp;The local police arranged for security for his family as India exited the
                World Cup in the first round.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni put his disappointing performances in the World Cup behind him by
                scoring 91* against&nbsp;Bangladesh, after India were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase.
                Dhoni was declared the Man of the Match for his performance, his fourth in ODI cricket. He was also
                later adjudged the Man of the Series after the third game of the series was washed away. Dhoni had a
                good Afro-Asia Cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out
                off 97 balls, a Man of the Match innings, in the third ODI.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South
                Africa in Ireland and the subsequent India-England seven-match ODI series.&nbsp;Dhoni, who received a
                &#39;B&#39; grade contract in December 2005, was awarded an &#39;A&#39; grade contract in June 2007. He
                was also elected as the captain of the Indian squad for the World Twenty20 in September 2007. On 2
                September 2007, Dhoni equalled his idol Adam Gilchrist&#39;s international record for the most
                dismissals in an innings in ODI by catching five English players and stumping one.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Rise through ranks</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">During the series between India and Australia in 2009, Dhoni scored&nbsp;124
                runs in 107 balls in the second ODI, and&nbsp;scored 71 runs in 95 balls&nbsp;in the third ODI. Along
                with Yuvraj Singh&#39;s 78 off of 96 balls, India won the third ODI by 6 wickets. Dhoni took his first
                and only wicket in international cricket on 30 September 2009. He bowled&nbsp;Travis Dowlin&nbsp;of
                the&nbsp;West Indies&nbsp;during a match in the&nbsp;2009 ICC Champions Trophy.</p>

                    style="height:110px; width:220px" /></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni topped the ICC ODI Batsman rankings for several months in
                2009.&nbsp;Michael Hussey&nbsp;from Australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni had an excellent year in ODIs in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24
                innings, at considerably high average of 70.43. Dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in ODIs in 2009
                along with Ricky Ponting, but the latter having played 30 innings. For his performances in 2009, he was
                named as captain and wicketkeeper of the World ODI XI by the ICC.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Post 2011 World Cup</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In&nbsp;2012, Pakistan toured India for a bilateral series for the first time
                in five years. In the three-match ODI series, Dhoni top-scored for India in all three innings; however,
                India lost the series 1&ndash;2. In the first ODI at&nbsp;Chennai, he helped India recover from 29/5 to
                help post a total of 227 in 50 overs. Scoring 113 not out, he had a record partnership
                with&nbsp;Ravichandran Ashwin, although India had lost .</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Winning the&nbsp;2013 ICC Champions Trophy, Dhoni became the first and the
                only captain in international cricket to claim all&nbsp;ICC&nbsp;trophies. In the rain-shortened final
                against&nbsp;England, he was out for a duck and ended the tournament with 27 runs from two innings.
                However, Dhoni&#39;s field placements and tactics were to India&#39;s advantage, as the team had beat
                the opposition by five runs (D/L method).&nbsp;He was also named as captain and wicketkeeper of the
                &#39;Team of the Tournament&#39; by the ICC.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Just after the Champions Trophy, India toured&nbsp;West Indies&nbsp;for a
                tri-nation tournament against&nbsp;West Indies&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sri Lanka.&nbsp;Dhoni had gotten injured at
                the start of the tournament itself and got ruled out for the whole tournament. However, despite not
                having fully recovered, he returned to play the final against Sri Lanka, once again only to find himself
                become a hero after single-handedly taking India to a victory by one wicket. Dhoni scored an unbeaten 45
                off 52 balls while scoring 16 runs in the final over required for the victory. He was adjudged Man of
                the match for this performance.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In November 2013, Dhoni became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar
                to aggregate 1,000 or more ODI-runs against Australia.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India toured&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;and&nbsp;New Zealand&nbsp;in the
                2013&ndash;14 season and ending up losing both series, 0&ndash;2 and 0&ndash;4, respectively. Against
                South Africa, Dhoni managed 84 runs at an average of 48.0, including one half-century. Against New
                Zealand, he managed 272 runs which included three consecutive 50-plus scores. In the third match of the
                series, his knock of 50 helped India tie the match and eventually avoiding a series whitewash.
                Meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in ODI cricket on the tour.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India won the away ODI series in England in&nbsp;2014&nbsp;by 3&ndash;1
                and&nbsp;series&nbsp;against West Indies in India by 2&ndash;1 margin. Dhoni had performed, as he scored
                a half-century in each of the series.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">2015 World Cup</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India&#39;s preparation going into the tournament looked poor, as India had
                failed to perform in the&nbsp;Carlton Mid Triangular Series in Australia, failing to win a single match,
                with Dhoni himself managing 70 runs from three innings and averaging 23.34.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">During the&nbsp;2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain
                to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. India achieved wins against
                arch-rivals&nbsp;Pakistan,&nbsp;South Africa&nbsp;(whom they hadn&#39;t beaten before in a World Cup
                game), the&nbsp;UAE,&nbsp;West Indies,&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Zimbabwe. In the match
                against&nbsp;Zimbabwe&nbsp;at&nbsp;Eden Park, he made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an unbeaten
                partnership of 196 with&nbsp;Suresh Raina. This is the highest score by an Indian captain on New Zealand
                soil. Beating&nbsp;Bangladesh&nbsp;in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the first
                non-Australian captain to win 100 ODI matches. In an unsuccessful effort against eventual champions
                Australia in the semi-finals, he made 65 as India were unable to defend their title. Dhoni, however,
                performed well with the bat by scoring 237 runs in 6 innings at an average of 59.25 and a&nbsp;strike
                rate&nbsp;of 102.15 and thus, became only the second Indian captain to have an average over 50 and
                strike rate over 100 in a particular season of the World Cup.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Stepping down as captain and thereafter</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January
                2017, just ahead of the ODI series at&nbsp;home against England.&nbsp;In the second game of the series,
                he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along
                with&nbsp;Yuvraj Singh. The century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years.&nbsp;He was
                named as a wicketkeeper of the &#39;Team of the Tournament&#39; at the 2017 Champions Trophy by
                Cricbuzz.&nbsp;He was also named in the ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In August that year, during the fifth and final ODI&nbsp;against Sri
                Lanka&nbsp;in&nbsp;Colombo, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings
                surpassing&nbsp;Kumar Sangakkara, when he&nbsp;stumped&nbsp;Akila Dananjaya&nbsp;off&nbsp;Yuzvendra
                Chahal.&nbsp;He reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in ODIs in February 2018, following
                the stumping of&nbsp;Aiden Markram&nbsp;in the third ODI of the&nbsp;South Africa tour.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni went past 10,000 ODI runs in the second ODI against England during his
                team&#39;s&nbsp;2018 tour, and became the fourth Indian and twelfth overall to do so.&nbsp;He had a
                relatively mediocre series, having scored 79 runs in two innings at a strike rate of 63.20.&nbsp;This
                was followed by two poor performances for him in the ODI format; the&nbsp;Asia Cup&nbsp;that he finished
                with 77 runs in four innings at an average of 19.25&nbsp;and the&nbsp;home series against West
                Indies&nbsp;where he aggregated 50 runs from three innings.&nbsp;Dhoni was given rest and thus
                wasn&#39;t available for the selection of the T20I squads for the series that followed and
                the&nbsp;Australia tour&nbsp;later that season.&nbsp;However, he was included in the squad named for the
                ODI series there.&nbsp;In the three-match series, Dhoni found form and scored half-centuries in all
                three games with the latter two resulting in wins, helping India secure a 2&ndash;1 series victory,
                their first in a bilateral series on Australian soil. Dhoni finished with 193 runs and was named player
                of the series. He also became the fourth Indian to score more than 1,000 ODI runs there.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In April 2019, he was named in&nbsp;India&#39;s squad&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2019
                Cricket World Cup.&nbsp;In July 2019, in India&#39;s semi-final match against&nbsp;New Zealand, Dhoni
                played in his 350th ODI.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">Test career</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Following his one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni
                replaced&nbsp;Dinesh Karthik&nbsp;in December 2005 as the Indian teams&#39; Test
                wicket-keeper.&nbsp;Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. Dhoni came to the
                crease when the team was at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling in quick succession, he played an
                aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed.&nbsp;Dhoni made his maiden half-century
                in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (50 off 51 balls) helped India set a target of 436, where
                the Sri Lankans were then bowled out for 247.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">India toured Pakistan in January&ndash;February 2006 and Dhoni scored his
                maiden century in the second Test at&nbsp;Faisalabad. India was struggling, where Dhoni along
                with&nbsp;Irfan Pathan&nbsp;tried to recover, with the team still needing 107 runs to avoid a follow-on.
                Dhoni played in his naturally aggressive style as he brought up his maiden Test century in 93 balls,
                after scoring the first fifty in 34 deliveries.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni followed up the century with respectable batting performances over the
                next three matches, one against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding
                a 1&ndash;0 lead. Dhoni was the top scorer in India&#39;s first innings in the third Test
                at&nbsp;Wankhede Stadium&nbsp;as his 64 helped India post 279 in reply to England&#39;s 400. However,
                Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key
                stumping opportunity of&nbsp;Andrew Flintoff&nbsp;(14).&nbsp;Dhoni failed to collect the&nbsp;Harbhajan
                Singh&nbsp;delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as England set a target of 313 for
                the home team, a target that India was never in danger of threatening. A batting collapse saw the team
                being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses
                as well as his shot selection.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify"><img alt=""
                    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Dhoni_behind_Stumps.jpg/220px-Dhoni_behind_Stumps.jpg"
                    style="height:175px; width:220px" /></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">On the&nbsp;West Indies tour&nbsp;in 2006, Dhoni scored a quick and aggressive
                69 in the first Test at&nbsp;Antigua. The rest of the series was unremarkable for Dhoni as he scored 99
                runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with
                13 catches and 4&nbsp;stumpings. In the Test series in South Africa later that year, Dhoni&#39;s scores
                of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second Test against the Proteas, as India lost the series
                2&ndash;1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever Test victory in South Africa (achieved in
                the first Test match). Dhoni&#39;s bruised hands ruled him out of the third Test match.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">On the fourth day of the first Test match at&nbsp;Antigua Recreation
                Ground,&nbsp;St John&#39;s,&nbsp;Antigua&nbsp;during&nbsp;India&#39;s tour of West Indies, 2006,
                Dhoni&#39;s flick off&nbsp;Dave Mohammed&nbsp;to the midwicket region was caught by&nbsp;Daren Ganga. As
                the batsman started to walk back, captain Dravid declared the innings when the confusion started as the
                umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and Dhoni stayed for the umpire&#39;s
                verdict. While the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the West Indies side,&nbsp;Brian Lara,
                wanted Dhoni to walk off based on the fielder&#39;s assertion of the catch. The impasse continued for
                more than 15 minutes and Lara&#39;s temper was on display with finger-wagging against the umpires and
                snatching the ball from umpire&nbsp;Asad Rauf. Ultimately, Dhoni walked off and Dravid&#39;s declaration
                was effected but the game was delayed, and Lara&#39;s action was criticised by the commentators and
                former players. Lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions, but he was
                not fined.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni scored two centuries in Sri Lanka&#39;s tour of India in 2009, a series
                of three matches in which he led India to a 2&ndash;0 victory. With this feat, India soared up to the
                number one position in Test cricket for the first time in history. India scored 726&ndash;9 (decl) in
                the third match of this series, which was their highest Test total then.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">He played his last series in the 2014&ndash;15 season in&nbsp;India&#39;s tour
                of Australia&nbsp;captaining India in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the
                third, trailing the series 2&ndash;0 before the Sydney Test. Following the third Test in&nbsp;Melbourne,
                Dhoni announced his retirement from the format.&nbsp;In his last Test, he effected nine dismissals
                (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past&nbsp;Kumar Sangakkara&nbsp;in the record
                for&nbsp;stumpings&nbsp;with 134 (in all three formats combined).&nbsp;He also set a record for
                effecting the most dismissals in a match by an&nbsp;Indian wicketkeeper&nbsp;until it was broken
                by&nbsp;Wriddhiman Saha&nbsp;in 2018.&nbsp;He finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.</p>

            <h3 style="text-align:justify">T20I career</h3>

            <p style="text-align:justify">On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide&nbsp;India&nbsp;to
                their first win over&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;at Adelaide. In the final over, he hit considerably large six
                which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of&nbsp;Clint McKay. During the post-match presentation, he
                described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">He was named as captain and wicketkeeper of the &#39;Team of the
                Tournament&#39; for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the ICC.</p>

            <h4 style="text-align:justify">2007 ICC World Twenty20</h4>

            <p style="text-align:justify">MS Dhoni was chosen to lead India in first-ever&nbsp;World T20 in 2007. He
                made his captaincy debut against Scotland but the match was washed off. Thereon, he led India to the ICC
                World Twenty 20 trophy in South Africa, with a victory over arch-rivals Pakistan in an intensely fought
                final on 24 September 2007, and became the second Indian captain to have won a World Cup in any form of
                cricket, after&nbsp;Kapil Dev.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for US$1.5 million. This
                made him the most expensive player in the IPL for the first season auctions. Under his captaincy, CSK

                of&nbsp;spot-fixing&nbsp;According to Dhoni, it was darkest period of his career. He said &quot;The
                biggest crime that I can commit is not a murder, it is actually&nbsp;match-fixing&quot;.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In 2016,&nbsp;Rising Pune Supergiant&nbsp;(RPS), a debuting IPL franchise team
                made him captain but after poor performance of the team in that season they removed Dhoni from
                captain&#39;s position and chose&nbsp;Steve Smith, then Australian national team captain, for the post.
                Dhoni played as wicketkeeper batsman in 2017 season for RPS.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In the&nbsp;2018 IPL season, CSK returned to IPL, and he was again appointed
                to lead the franchise by the franchise. Dhoni scored 455 runs in that season and led his side to their
                third IPL title.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">In the 2020 &amp; 2021 seasons of the IPL, Dhoni failed to perform where he
                scored 200 runs in 14 innings in 2020 and 116 runs in 16 innings with an average of 15.29 in 2021 IPL
                season.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">He led the franchise to 4th title in&nbsp;2021 Indian Premier
                League&nbsp;season. Dhoni got retained by CSK for ₹12 Cr, before IPL 2022 player&#39;s auction.&nbsp;He
                stepped down from captaincy on 24 March 2022, where&nbsp;Ravindra Jadeja&nbsp;became the new
                captain.However, on 30 April 2022, Jadeja handed over the captaincy back to Dhoni.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align:justify">Playing style</h2>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Dhoni is a right-handed&nbsp;batsman&nbsp;and&nbsp;wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an
                unorthodox batsman, in the sense that much of his batting technique does not follow coaching manuals.
                Dhoni prefers to hit a full ball to&nbsp;Long-on,&nbsp;Long-off&nbsp;or&nbsp;Midwicket&nbsp;regions
                rather than driving it to the&nbsp;Cover&nbsp;region. Not only taking advantage of&nbsp;full length
                balls, he also displays skill in playing pull shots &amp; hook shots off of short balls, which applies
                pressure to the bowler to bowl to him. He holds the bat firmly at the bottom of the handle and tries to
                hit the ball hard and flat to clear the boundary. Yet, he manages to hit long sixes at times.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually
                changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a
                captain. He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the
                wickets.&nbsp;He made use of the&nbsp;helicopter shot&nbsp;technique,&nbsp;taught to him by a fellow
                player and childhood friend&nbsp;Santosh Lal.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">His wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts but also
                criticised for lack of good technique.&nbsp;He has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by
                any wicket-keeper.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify">As a captain Dhoni, was approachable to players.<span
                    style="font-size:10.8333px"> </span>Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his
                behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. He used to allow bowlers to set field for themselves.
